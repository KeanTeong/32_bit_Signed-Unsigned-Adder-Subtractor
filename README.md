# 32_bit_Signed-Unsigned-Adder-Subtractor
The 32-bit signed and unsigned adder and subtractor, implemented in Verilog code, represent vital components for performing arithmetic operations in computer systems. Developed within the Visual Studio code environment and compiled using Icarus Verilog, these modules have been thoroughly tested and verified with a meticulously designed testbench. The GTK Wave simulator has been employed to visualize the waveforms, ensuring comprehensive analysis of circuit behavior. The signed adder module employs the two's complement representation, intelligently handling positive and negative numbers while detecting and managing overflow conditions. Conversely, the unsigned adder provides precise results for unsigned integers. The signed subtractor adeptly handles signed numbers, considering overflow and borrow-out scenarios, while the unsigned subtractor excels at subtracting unsigned integers. These modules collectively guarantee accurate and reliable arithmetic operations within a 32-bit framework.
